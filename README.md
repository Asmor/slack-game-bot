# slack-game-bot
Game bot for Slack

# Installation

Check out and run

`npm install`

After that, copy `config.sample.js` to `config.js`, and insert your bot's API token in the appropriate spot in that file.

# Usage

`npm start`

This will start the bot. The bot currently only supports Russian Roulette, and only in a room named "#russian-roulette". It will listen to any message containing "russian roulette" in that room and may or may not shoot you (1/6 chance).

May the odds be ever in your favor.
